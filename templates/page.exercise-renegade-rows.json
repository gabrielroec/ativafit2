This exercise targets the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and middle trapezius while simultaneously engaging the entire core, including the rectus abdominis, obliques, and deep stabilizers. The unilateral nature of the movement challenges balance and coordination, making it an excellent exercise for developing functional strength and improving overall body control."
