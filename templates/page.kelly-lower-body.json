By taking a wide stance with your toes pointed outward, you create a different muscle activation pattern that targets muscles often neglected in standard squats. This exercise is perfect for building inner thigh strength, developing powerful glutes, and creating a well-rounded, balanced lower body. The wide stance also allows for a deeper range of motion, increasing muscle engagement and flexibility."
