This will simplify the process of attaching the frame leg tubes.<br/><strong>04.</strong> Jump Mat Installation: Begin by attaching springs diagonally across the cross pipe, then evenly install the remaining springs around the mat for balanced tension.<br/><strong>05.</strong> Spring Installation: Utilize the drag hook provided to lift and securely attach each spring.<br/><strong>06.</strong> Safety Pad Installation: Align the holes in the safety pad with the cross pipes and secure them using the elastic hooks to cover the springs thoroughly.<br/><strong>07.</strong> Support Rods Setup: Insert the end of each support rod (with the silver buckle facing downwards) into the cross pipes to build the net framework.<br/><strong>08.</strong> Safety Net Assembly: Elevate the safety net to its highest possible height to facilitate sliding it onto the last rod easily. Then, lower the safety net and secure its base using hooks.<br/><strong>09.</strong> Toy Accessories Installation: When setting up the basketball rack, remember to remove the protective head from the support rod prior to installation for a seamless fit.</p>",
