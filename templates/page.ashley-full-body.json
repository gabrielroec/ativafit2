This movement combines a punching motion with a rotational component, creating maximum engagement in your obliques and shoulders. The cross-body punching pattern challenges your core stability and helps develop rotational strength, which is essential for athletic performance and daily activities. When performed with proper form and controlled power, cross punches create exceptional core and shoulder engagement while enhancing your overall functional fitness."
